## Data Publishing Guidance
        
### Determine the Publishing Priority of Open Data

                - Each department shall determine the publishing
                  priority status of it’s Open Data. 
                  - Once data is classified as open and not protected, the next step is to determine whether that data is appropriate for publishing on the City of Boston Open Data Portal.  Some data that is public record technically may nonetheless be inappropriate for publishing as open data.  For example, it is possible that some data, while individually public record can, if cross-tabulated by third parties with other openly available datasets, constitute an violation of reasonable expectations of privacy and other information security risks.  Until applicable federal and state law catches up to these risks, it is important for each department to actively consider and use reasonable judgement as to whether data that has been classified as open is in fact appropriate to be published "as is" on the open data portal or not.  In some cases, it may be advisable to redact certain features of the dataset to limit the potential risks of harm or to delay publishing of inappropriate data until a prudent and safe plan is adopted.  
                  
                - After data has both been classified as open and also determined to be appropriate for publishing, then the department shall determine the priority order in which such data is to be published.  Given the limited resources available to accomplish full publishing of all appropriate open data, it is important to prioritize the publishing of the most important data sets and to set a general priority-order for the publishing of all such data over a reasonable period of time. 
                
                - The priority status for establishing which Open Data to publish
                  first shall be based upon due consideration of all
                  factors relevant to that department and data. 
                  Priority publishing status may include consideration
                  of whether the public interest is materially served
                  by providing access to the data because: 
                - Volume: The data is of a type that is of significant
                  size and continually provided and/or of very large
                  size and periodically provided;
                - Velocity: Rapid access to the data is important and
                  rendering the data accessible through
                  data.cityofboston.gov is the most effective, least
                  expensive or otherwise highest value method to enable
                  immediate access to the data;
                - Variability: The data fluctuates at a high rate and
                  access to the then current state of the data is of
                  value
                - Variety: The addition of the data, when used in
                  combination with other data sets, affords enhanced
                  compound value.
                - Validity: The data sheds light upon the legitimacy of
                  government or the acts of government, such as ethics
                  disclosures and violations or the conduct of
                  elections and response to election fraud or other
                  violations;
                - Veracity:  The data provides verifiable metrics from
                  an authoritative public source, such as weights and
                  measures, census and vital statistics, reported
                  crime, public health or other data sets for which
                  accurate readings are required to correctly calibrate
                  or response by sensitive, mission critical, high risk
                  or high value systems; and
                - Value: Rendering the data accessible via
                  data.cityofboston.gov or an appropriate alternative
                  publishing method in in the public interest and/or
                  yields other material sources of value to government,
                  the private sector, a definable subset of a sector
                  and/or the public at large. [Comments: Consider adding in a reference to the value of the data to the stakeholder.]

        - Publishing Workflow and Approval Chain
            - Each department head shall confirm or update the names
              and contact information for the individuals noted on the
              Open Data Manager business and legal points of contact
              roster for their department.
            - Each department head shall conduct an initial assessment
              of the types and amounts of data sets for which it is
              responsible.  This assessment shall include:
                - The name of each data set whether the data set is
                  expected to be classified as open and public or
                  protected from disclosure; 
                - A short one or two sentence abstract describing what
                  the data is comprised of and how it is used by or
                  with the department; and
                - the name of the software, platform or other system or
                  systems through which the data flows or where the
                  data is stored.
            - Each department head shall establish a plan for the
              classification of its data sets as open or protected
            - The departmental Open Data business contact shall deliver
              to the Open Data Manager their department initial
              assessment of its data sets and data classification plan
                  Is a time period needed for completion of this task?
 
            - Expedite publishing of at least two open data sets:
                - This initial set of guidance on publishing open data
                  is intended to provide sufficient detail to support
                  the classification and publication of at least two
                  datasets by every department on an expedited basis. 
                  The experience gained by publishing some open data
                  quickly will be an important source of information
                  about the relevant data types and classification
                  needs of each department.  The process of publishing
                  at least a couple of open data sets will also clarify
                  or confirm the essential business, legal and
                  technical elements relevant to the open data
                  publishing workflow and approval chain for each
                  department.

            - Outreach to stakeholder communities
                - The business contact for Open Data of each department
                  shall endeavor to identify the relevant stakeholder
                  communities that will use and rely upon the
                  publication of each open data set of their
                  department, including identification of a simple,
                  effective and repeatable means for notifying
                  stakeholder communities of the availability of
                  relevant published open data or the additions to or
                  other updating of such open data. 
[Comments: The identification of stakeholders appears to have strong links with the determination of priority publishing status. By identifying groups most dependent on the data, departments will be determining which groups need the data the most. The organization of this policy may benefit by adding the stakeholder's section into the list of due factors to be considered in measuring publishing priority.]

# Commentary to accompany Open Data Policy section on departments establishing appropriateness to PUBLISH data after classified as open:

### The process of establishing appropriate data classification and sharing routines:

                - While it is the aspiration of Open Government to
                  eventually have all public records available in
                  accessible formats as open data, the transition from
                  industrial era document-centered systems to
                  data-driven networked systems requires time.   This
                  process of transition to digital footing for the City
                  of Boston will require periodic and interdependent
                  reforms across every discipline and domain of city
                  government.  Rendering public records as open data is
                  an important step toward successful digital
                  transition.  The development of reliable and
                  efficient methods to identify and classify Protected
                  Data and to distinguish it from Open Data will
                  require iterative cycles of progress and phases of
                  refinement.  Civilian governmental departments at the
                  local, state and federal levels are not accustomed to
                  defining and classifying all data in their possession
                  as open or protected.  Response to public information
                  requests on a case by case basis require a very
                  different  and much narrower approach to data
                  classification. More importantly, the current state
                  of law and policy has been overtaken by the pace of
                  technical change.  The advance of widely accessible
                  data analytics capabilities has changed the playing
                  field with respect to privacy and personal data
                  management.  Today, distinguishing whether data
                  disclosure may reveal individual identities is a
                  vastly more complex challenge because the compilation
                  of otherwise public data by third parties using big
                  data analytics can result in violation of reasonable
                  expectations to privacy.  In order to publish open
                  data while appropriately managing privacy and other
                  risks, a careful and deliberate approach must be
                  established and refined over time.  The process of
                  establishing mature and stable data classification
                  and publishing policies begins with adherence to the
                  criteria set by Mayor Walsh in his Executive Order on
                  open and protected data and will continue through
                  cycles of revisions and amendments to City of Boston
                  information practices, policies and procedures.   All
                  parts of municipal government are involved in the
                  transition to a data-driven city.  City of Boston
                  public administration and departmental operations
                  (the business layer), rules and policy (the legal
                  layer) as well as systems and procedures (the
                  technical layer) each play an important part in the
                  governance of this transition.  As the transformation
                  to a data-driven networked city unfolds, the
                  business, legal and technical layers of municipal
                  government will evolve significantly.  Although the
                  municipal governments of Boston is a recognized
                  leader at effective use of technology and data, in
                  order to achieve the enterprise wide publishing of
                  open data it is important for all departments to
                  follow a simple, sustainable and stepwise approach.
